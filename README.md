# FreeFood
The goal of this project is to create a web app that allows students on Princeton's campus to find free food left over from events. Clubs and organizations with left over food would post a listing with a picture and a description of the food available as well as click their location on the interactive map. Then, students could browse these listings and mark the listings that they are interested in going to. Students are also able the filter the food listings available by dietary preferences and restrictions. This systems allows students to see what the supply and demand of free food is all over campus. The project would benefit the campus by reducing food waste and helping students get fed.
